1. Open a new terminal window (Ctrl + Alt + t) and enter

$ roscore

2. Run turtlesim_node in the turtlesim package; Open a new terminal window and enter:

$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

3. Open new terminal and try the following (one by one):

$ rostopic list

$ rostopic type /turtle1/cmd_vel

$ rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist

4. Next, open new terminal and try the following to move the turtlebot with the inputs:
$ rostopic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist “linear: 
	x:1 
	y:0 
	z:0 
angular: 
	x:0 
	y:0 
	z:1.57”

***Note that you do not need to enter the complete command. Use the Tab key to autocomplete the command. Just type rostopic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel, and keep pressing the Tab key to autocomplete other fields. Don’t forget to change the linear.x and angular.z values first before pressing the Enter key
