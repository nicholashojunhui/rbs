(A) Steps for moving the turtlebot based on input velocities:

1. Open a new terminal window (Ctrl + Alt + t) and enter

$ roscore

2. Run turtlesim_node in the turtlesim package; Open a new terminal window and enter:

$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

3. Open new terminal and type the following:

$ rosrun robotics move_turtle.py 1.0 1.57

This code makes the turtle moves in a circle. You can change the input values to your liking

*ensure that your codes are in the src folder of your robotics package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x your_codes.py)


(B) Steps for moving the turtlebot based on input velocities and position:

1. Open a new terminal window (Ctrl + Alt + t) and enter

$ roscore

2. Run turtlesim_node in the turtlesim package; Open a new terminal window and enter:

$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

3. Open new terminal and type the following:

$ rosrun robotics move_distance.py 1.0 0.0 8.0

This code makes the turtle moves forward until x = 8.0m at a velocity of 1 m/s. You can change the input values to your liking. Note that the initial position of the turtle is [x=5.54, y=5.54, theta=0.0]

*ensure that your codes are in the src folder of your robotics package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x your_codes.py)
