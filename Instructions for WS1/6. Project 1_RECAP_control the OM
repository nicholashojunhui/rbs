1. Open terminal in Ubuntu and run roscore

$ roscore

2. Prepare the setup for the OM: Connect the wires, switch on the power, and manually bring up the OM

3. On another terminal, activate the controller

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_controller open_manipulator_controller.launch

***If you encounter permission issues, type command:
$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

4. On another terminal, ROSRUN your codes

$ rosrun robotics Project1.py

*ensure that your codes are in the src folder of your robotics package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x your_codes.py)

***Hints: Use control_om.py as a template to build your codes; you will also need to use rospy.sleep() codes in between each step.
