$ cd pyFirmata
$ sudo python setup.py install

2. Open Arduino IDE to open the StandardFirmata sketch: 

Go to File -> then Examples -> then Firmata -> then StandardFirmata

3. Upload the Firmata Sketch into the Arduino Board so that you can use pyFirmata to control the board

(a) Connect the PC and the Arduino board via the USB cable
(b) Select the appropriate board (i.e. Uno) & port (e.g. ACM0) on the IDE
(c) Upload the StandardFirmata sketch to the board
(d) When the upload is finished, you won't notice any activity on the Arduino
(e) Now you are ready to control the board via the pyFirmata package in Python

***Note: If your port is denied permission, on new terminal type:
	$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
