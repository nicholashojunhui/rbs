Using the previous examples as references, develop a new python file:

IntegratingSensors.py

For this practice, you will learn how to control desirable outputs based on the sensorsâ€™ input. Connect an LED bulb to the Arduino board as demonstrated in the TestLED example; this LED bulb will be simulating the output for this practice.

Your inputs will be utilizing the light, analog temperature and button sensors. Refer to the conditions in the table in Slide 65.

Recap on Configuration:

1. Ensure your board is disconnected from your PC first. Prepare Light, Temperature (Gravity LM35 Analog type) and button sensors, and connect them to the Arduino board.

2. Connect the board with the PC using the USB cable; you do not need to use the Arduino IDE software

3. Open terminal and cd to the correct directory to where you put your python files:

$ cd ~/Desktop 
for example

4. Open new Terminal and run the python file:

$ python3 integratingsensors.py

This is a simple programme to read data from the 3 sensors and the output will be triggered based on the inputs from these sensors
